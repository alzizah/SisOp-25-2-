**Answer:**  
- **Process:** A self-contained execution unit with its own memory space.  
- **Thread:** A lightweight execution unit within a process that shares the same memory space.  
*Example:* In a web browser, each tab may run as a separate thread or process depending on the implementation.

### 1.14 Deadlock
**Question:** What is a deadlock? Provide an example of a deadlock situation in an operating system.  
**Answer:**  
A deadlock is a situation where two or more processes are each waiting for resources held by the other, and none can proceed.  
*Example:* Process A holds a printer and waits for a scanner held by Process B, while Process B waits for the printer held by Process A.

### 1.15 Deadlock Avoidance
**Question:** Describe methods for avoiding deadlock in an operating system.  
**Answer:**  
Methods include:  
- **Bankerâ€™s Algorithm:** Ensuring resource allocation does not lead to an unsafe state.  
- **Deadlock Prevention:** Implementing rules to ensure conditions for deadlock do not occur (e.g., avoiding simultaneous resource holding).  
- **Deadlock Detection and Recovery:** Periodically detecting deadlock and taking corrective actions, such as terminating one of the processes.

### 1.16 Scheduling
**Question:** What is scheduling in an operating system context? Name some common scheduling algorithms.  
**Answer:**  
Scheduling is the process of determining the order in which processes are executed by the CPU. Common algorithms include:  
- **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS):** Processes are executed in the order they arrive.  
- **Shortest Job Next (SJN):** Processes with the shortest execution time are scheduled first.  
- **Round Robin:** Each process receives a fixed time quantum in cyclic order.  
- **Priority Scheduling:** Processes with higher priority are scheduled before lower-priority ones.

### 1.17 Time-Sharing and Multiprogramming
**Question:** Explain the concept of time-sharing and how an operating system supports multiprogramming in a time-sharing context.  
**Answer:**  
Time-sharing is a technique that rapidly allocates CPU time among many processes so that each appears to have exclusive access. This is achieved through preemptive scheduling, allowing fast context switching between processes.

### 1.18 Inter-Process Communication (IPC)

### 1.19 Virtual Memory and Paging
**Question:** Explain the concept of virtual memory and how paging assists in memory management.  
**Answer:**  
Virtual memory enables the operating system to use secondary storage (disk) to extend the apparent size of physical memory. Paging divides memory into fixed-size blocks (pages), allowing non-contiguous allocation of memory, which improves efficiency and flexibility.

### 1.20 Swappable Space
**Question:** What is the role of swappable space in memory management, and how is it implemented in modern operating systems?  
**Answer:**  
Swappable space is an area on disk used to temporarily store data from main memory when there is insufficient physical memory. Through swapping, the operating system can move parts of processes between RAM and disk to optimize memory usage.

### 1.21 Kernel Mode vs. User Mode
**Question:** Explain what kernel mode and user mode are, and why this division is important for system security.  
**Answer:**  
- **Kernel Mode:** A mode of operation where the code has full access to hardware and critical system instructions.  
- **User Mode:** A restricted mode of operation designed to prevent applications from performing dangerous operations that could compromise system stability and security.  
This separation is essential to protect the system from errors or malicious actions.

### 1.22 Interrupts and Interrupt Handlers
**Question:** What are interrupts in an operating system, and what is the role of an interrupt handler?  
**Answer:**  
Interrupts are signals sent by hardware or software to alert the CPU of an important event, temporarily halting the current process. An interrupt handler is a specialized routine that processes the interrupt, ensuring a quick and proper response to the event.

### 1.23 Preemptive vs. Non-Preemptive Scheduling
**Question:** Explain the difference between preemptive and non-preemptive scheduling.  
**Answer:**  
- **Preemptive Scheduling:** The operating system can interrupt a running process before it finishes, allowing another process to run.  
- **Non-Preemptive Scheduling:** A process, once given the CPU, runs until it completes or performs an I/O operation, without interruption by the scheduler.

### 1.24 Multiprocessor Systems
**Question:** What are multiprocessor systems, and how do operating systems support parallel computing in such environments?  
**Answer:**  
Multiprocessor systems utilize more than one CPU to execute processes in parallel. Operating systems support this through load balancing, efficient synchronization, and inter-process communication to distribute workloads evenly across CPUs.

### 1.25 I/O Device Management and the Role of Drivers
**Question:** Explain how operating systems manage I/O devices and the role of device drivers.  
**Answer:**  
Operating systems manage I/O devices by queuing requests, buffering data, and using interrupts to facilitate communication with hardware. Device drivers act as intermediaries between the operating system and the hardware, translating OS commands into instructions the device can understand.

### 1.26 Booting Process
**Question:** What is the booting process in an operating system? Describe its main steps.  
**Answer:**  
The booting process is the initialization sequence that occurs when a computer is powered on. The main steps include:  
- **POST (Power-On Self Test):** The BIOS/UEFI performs an initial hardware check.  
- **Bootloader:** A small program that loads the operating system's kernel from storage into memory.  
- **Kernel Initialization:** The kernel takes control of the hardware and prepares the system for user processes.

### 1.27 Recovery and Fault Tolerance
**Question:** Explain the concepts of recovery and fault tolerance in the context of operating systems.  
**Answer:**  
- **Recovery:** The process of restoring the system after an error or failure, often through backups and system restarts.
